# Sorting Algorithms Visualization

This project provides a simple tool to visualize the working process of several popular sorting algorithms. It aims to help users understand how these algorithms operate step-by-step by displaying the sorting process in an intuitive way.

## Features

- Visualization of the following sorting algorithms:
  - **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  - **Selection Sort**: An algorithm that divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region, repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and moving it to the sorted region.
  - **Quick Sort**: A highly efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
- Interactive or step-by-step visualization of the sorting process.
- Easy-to-understand graphical representation of array changes.
